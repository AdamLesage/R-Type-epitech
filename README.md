# R-Type Reproduction
> This project is part of the 3rd year of the Epitech curriculum.

A reproduction of the famous game R-Type, made in C++.

To see more about R-Type, you can visit the [R-Type Wikipedia page](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-Type).

## Installing / Getting started

To install the project, you can clone the repository and compile it with the CMakeLists.txt file.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:AdamLesage/R-Type-epitech.git
cd R-Type-epitech
```

This will create a directory called `R-Type-epitech` in the current directory.

`cd R-Type-epitech` will move you into the directory.

### Initial Configuration

Need to create initial configuration, it will be a list of commands to run the project in the first time.

## Developing

Need to create developing section, it will be a list of commands to run the project in development mode.

### Building

To install the project, you can clone the repository and compile it with the CMakeLists.txt file.

```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

This will create an executable file called `rtype` in the `build` directory.

But you can also use our script to compile the project.

```shell
chmod +x start_project.sh
./start_project.sh
```

The command `chmod +x start_project.sh` will give the execution rights to the script, and `./start_project.sh` will execute the script.

### Deploying / Publishing

Need to create deploying/publishing section, it will be a list of commands to deploy the project.

## Features

Need to create features section, it will be a list of features on project.

## Contributing

When you publish something open source, one of the greatest motivations is that
anyone can just jump in and start contributing to your project.

These paragraphs are meant to welcome those kind souls to feel that they are
needed. You should state something like:

"If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and use a feature
branch. Pull requests are warmly welcome."

If there's anything else the developer needs to know (e.g. the code style
guide), you should link it here. If there's a lot of things to take into
consideration, it is common to separate this section to its own file called
`CONTRIBUTING.md` (or similar). If so, you should say that it exists here.
